"2","CC Batch 1","EARLY STAGE — COHORT

What will go wrong
* Number systems concepts will be incorrectly applied, leading to calculation errors.
* Vocabulary confusion and misinterpretation will impact reading comprehension and verbal accuracy.
* Inability to arrange sentences logically will create paragraph coherence issues in exams.

What exactly to fix
* Review number properties, LCM/HCF, and divisibility rules with varied problems.
* Enhance vocabulary through contextual usage and synonym/antonym exercises daily.
* Practice identifying topic sentences and logical connectors for coherent paragraph construction.
","MID-COURSE STAGE — CC Batch 1

What will go wrong

","PRE-EXAM STAGE — COHORT

What will go wrong
* Permutations & Combinations will cause major cohort-level score drop.
* Time management skills shaky; multiple topics will drag down overall attempt rate.
* RC inference and vocab questions will be a low-accuracy, high-time-spent zone.

What exactly to fix
* Drill P&C formula selection in complex, constraint-based questions.
* Practice efficient timer management; do rapid topic-switching drills.
* Teach quick RC inference tactics; use context to boost vocab recall.
